Tasks of Five Sprints of this Project : <br>

__Sprint 01 :__ Select an [already built project](https://github.com/harismuneer/Restaurant-Management-System) or build a new one and evaluate whether the selected project is an appropriate one or not.  <br> <br>
__Sprint 02 :__ Draw [Use Case and Class Diagram](https://github.com/shoaibdipu/BRACU_CSE470_SoftwareEngineering/tree/master/Use%20Case%20%26%20Class%20Diagram) of the project using any online tool.  <br> <br>
__Sprint 03 :__ Identify the model, controller and view related codes of the selected project. And, then copy the corresponding code files in the designated folders. This sprint aims to separate the data models, UI and server logic-related codes as done in MVC.  <br> <br>
__Sprint 04 :__ [Re-run the restructured MVC project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3vLrIJhWuU). To do this successfully, fix some parts as changing the existing structure was required.  <br> <br>
