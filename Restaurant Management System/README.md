# 👨‍🍳 Restaurant Management System

__Original Repository :__ https://github.com/harismuneer/Restaurant-Management-System
## Project Description
DineOut is an **Android based Restaurant Management System** that aims to digitalize the process of various restaurant operations including **ordering, billing kitchen, hall and inventory management**. 

The main purpose is to **improve the performance** of the restaurant by eradicating the daily paperwork. With this system the tasks
would be performed in less amount of time and more efficiently. An additional benefit of this software is that during the rush hours the load can be balanced effectively, and restaurants would perform better than usual. In addition to this, human error that occurs when performing tasks manually is also minimized and presence of queues in the system to assign tasks to chefs can reduce congestion in the kitchen. The system would also result in reduction of labor which would result in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant. Feedback module would help the restaurant check for how well they are performing, and monthly/yearly figures can be checked by the billing module to see the trends in sales and profits. These benefits can potentially result in generation of more revenues for the restaurant. 

***For complete details regarding the Functional, Non-Functional Requirements and Analysis Models, you can refer to the detailed [Software Requirements Specification document](../master/documents/SRS%20(Latest).pdf).***

## Purpose
This application was developed as a final project for our **Software Engineering (CS303)** Course. The whole class was divided into teams of 4-5 members and each team was assigned a particular module of this Restaurant Management System. Besides coding our own module, at the end, **our team was also given the responsibility to meet other teams, discuss and resolve the issues that they are facing in the application and ultimately take their developed modules and integrate all the modules together into one working application**. This exercise made us familiar with the issues that occur during the integration of modules in real software projects like following consistent database schema, variable names, libraries versions etc.


## User Classes and Characteristics
There are **five** types of users for our system. 

### 1. Customer Class
Customers interact with our system directly in order to place order, modify order, get bill and give feedback. We do not store any information related to customers in our system. The process of order taking starts from customers placing order and then the other series of events begin.

### 2. Head Chef/Kitchen Manager
Head Chef can mark a dish as prepared when a chef tells him to do so. He can approve the cancellation of an order whenever a customer edits or removes a dish from his order. He can also assign a dish to a particular chef based on the specialty of the chef.

### 3. Chef
Chefs don’t interact with the system. They just have to look at the dishes present in their queues and prepare the dishes accordingly. Chef’s name, address and specialty etc. are stored in the database.

### 4. Admin
Admin’s job is to manage the inventory and other information related to menu and chefs in the system.

### 5. Hall Manager
Hall Managers will provide its input when he marks the bill as paid when customers pay for their order or get the bill printed. Moreover, he gets a notification whenever a particular order is complete, or some customer asks for help through the system. Hall manager can also see tables in the hall and their status i.e. empty or filled.
